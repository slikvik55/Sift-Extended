# Sift-Extended. Free Media Sorter for Windows

Sift is a fast, no-fuss media sorting tool for Windows. Open a folder of images, videos, or audio files, set up your destinations, and move through them one by one with a single keypress. Built for the moment you realize you have gigabytes of unsorted media and just need to get through it.

## About this fork

**Sift-Extended** is a fork of the original [Sift by NimbleCloud13](https://github.com/nimblecloud13) that adds performance improvements for large video collections, preview rotation, an in-page folder browser, a persistent mute control, more reliable file moves, and a streamlined destinations panel. All of the original functionality is preserved. See [What's new in this fork](#whats-new-in-this-fork) for details.

## What's new in this fork

- **Handles large video folders without freezing.** Thumbnails are generated lazily as items scroll into view (via an `IntersectionObserver`), with a concurrency-limited queue and small off-screen canvases, and the filmstrip and grid are built in non-blocking batches. Loading folders with hundreds of videos no longer hangs the page.
- **Rotate the preview.** Rotate-left / rotate-right buttons in the filmstrip rotate the current image or video preview in 90° steps (preview only, the file on disk is untouched). Rotated videos render through a `<canvas>` so they display correctly at 90°/270° instead of appearing blank.
- **In-page folder browser.** Browsing for a folder now opens a built-in file browser inside the app instead of a native OS dialog, so it works even on Python installs without `tkinter`. Backed by a new `/api/list_dir` endpoint.
- **Persistent mute button.** A mute toggle (🔊 / 🔇) in the video/audio control bar, also bound to the **M** key. The mute state carries over between videos and is remembered across sessions.
- **More reliable sorting of videos.** Fixes the intermittent `Unexpected token '<'` error when sifting a playing video. The browser's file handle is released before the move, transient Windows file locks are retried server-side, and API errors now always return JSON (never an HTML error page).
- **Combined destinations panel.** The "Sift Destinations" and "Sift Into Folder" sections are merged into one: each destination row has a compact colored numbered button (1–5) that both labels and triggers the sort.

## Features

- Supports images, video, and audio
- Up to 5 custom sort destinations with keyboard shortcuts (1–5)
- Filmstrip view with video thumbnails
- Re-sort already-sorted files into a different destination at any time
- Undo last sort with **Z**
- Filter view by media type (images, video, or audio)
- **Strip Metadata.** Duplicate any folder with embedded metadata removed from every file (images via Pillow, video/audio via ffmpeg)
- Slideshow mode with fullscreen support
- Scroll-to-zoom on images and video, with click-and-drag panning when zoomed in
- Paste any folder path directly into the path box and press Enter to load
- Runs locally. No internet connection, no account, no telemetry

## Additional Features

- **Strip Metadata.** Duplicate any folder with GPS tags, camera info, timestamps, and other personally identifying metadata scrubbed from every file. Original folder is untouched. Images are cleaned instantly. Video/audio files require ffmpeg. Sift will offer to install it automatically if needed, or you can skip those files
- **Grid view.** See all loaded images at once in a full-window grid. Adjustable column count, click any image to jump to it, optional autoscroll with speed control
- **Slideshow mode.** Auto-advance through files at an adjustable interval. Pair with fullscreen for a gallery experience
- **Display on Launch.** Choose whether Sift reopens your last folder on startup or opens blank
- **Light and dark mode.** Toggle between themes from the controls panel. Preference is remembered across sessions
- **Copy Path.** One-click copy of the current file's full path to the clipboard

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11
- Python 3.10+
- `tkinter` is optional. It is only used for the system-tray/taskbar window; Sift runs fine without it (folder browsing uses the built-in in-page browser). If it's missing, Sift falls back to plain terminal mode.

## Quick Start

### One-click install (recommended)

1. Create a folder where you want Sift to live (e.g. `C:\Sift`)
2. Download **[install.bat](install.bat)** from this repo into that folder
3. Double-click `install.bat`
4. A shortcut will appear on your Desktop. Double-click it to launch Sift

Sift installs into the same folder as `install.bat`, so put it where you want it to live before running. The installer will check for Python, download Sift, install all dependencies, and create a Desktop shortcut automatically.

> **Note:** Python 3.10+ is required. If you don't have it, the installer will open the download page for you. When installing Python, make sure to tick **"Add Python to PATH"**.

### Manual install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```
